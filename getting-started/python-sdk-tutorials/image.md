# Basic operations with images

## Introduction

In this tutorial we will focus on working with images using Supervisely SDK.

You will learn how to:

1. [upload images from local directory to Supervisely dataset.](#upload-images-from-local-directory-to-supervisely)
2. [upload images to Supervisely as NumPy matrix.](#upload-images-as-numpy-matrix)
3. [get information about images by id or name.](#get-information-about-images)
4. [download images from Supervisely to local directory.](#download-images-to-local-directory)
5. [download images from Supervisely as NumPy matrix.](#download-images-as-rgb-numpy-matrix)
6. [get and update image metadata](#get-and-update-image-metadata)
7. [remove images from Supervisely.](#remove-images-from-supervisely)

üìó Everything you need to reproduce [this tutorial is on GitHub](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/tutorial-image): source code and demo data.

## How to debug this tutorial

**Step 1.** Prepare `~/supervisely.env` file with credentials. [Learn more here.](../basics-of-authentication.md)

**Step 2.** Clone [repository](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/tutorial-image) with source code and demo data and create [Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

```
git clone https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/tutorial-image.git

cd tutorial-image

./create_venv.sh
```

**Step 3.** Open repository directory in Visual Studio Code.

```
code -r .
```

**Step 4.** Change workspace ID in `local.env` file by copying the ID from the context menu of the workspace.

```
context.workspaceId=654 # ‚¨ÖÔ∏è change value
```

**Step 5.** Start debugging `src/main.py`.

### Import libraries

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import supervisely as sly
```

### Init API client

First, we load environment variables with credentials and init API for communicating with Supervisely Instance.

```python
load_dotenv("local.env")
load_dotenv(os.path.expanduser("~/supervisely.env"))
api = sly.Api()
```

### Get variables from environment

In this tutorial, you will need an workspace ID that you can get from environment variables. [Learn more here](../environment-variables.md#workspace_id)

```python
workspace_id = sly.env.workspace_id()
```

### Create new project and dataset

Create new project.

**Source code:**

```python
project = api.project.create(workspace_id, "Fruits", change_name_if_conflict=True)

print(f"Project ID: {project.id}")
```

**Output:**

```python
# Project ID: 15599
```

Create new dataset.

**Source code:**

```python
dataset = api.dataset.create(project.id, "Fruits ds1")

print(f"Dataset ID: {dataset.id}")
```

**Output:**

```python
# Dataset ID: 53465
```

## Upload images from local directory to Supervisely

### Upload single image.

**Source code:**

```python
original_dir = "src/images/original"
path = os.path.join(original_dir, "lemons.jpg")
meta = {"my-field-1": "my-value-1", "my-field-2": "my-value-2"}

image = api.image.upload_path(
    dataset.id,
    name="Lemons",
    path=path,
    meta=meta # optional
)

print(f'Image "{image.name}" uploaded to Supervisely with ID:{image.id}')
```

**Output:**

```python
# Image "Lemons.jpeg" uploaded to Supervisely platform with ID:17539453
```

<figure><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79905215/209367792-2bd43e87-453f-4cba-9f41-9648a964658d.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### Upload list of images.

‚úÖ Supervisely API allows uploading multiple images in a single request. The code sample below sends fewer requests and it leads to a significant speed-up of our original code.

**Source code:**

```python
names = [
    "grapes-1.jpg",
    "grapes-2.jpg",
    "oranges-2.jpg",
    "oranges-1.jpg",
]
paths = [os.path.join(original_dir, name) for name in names]

upload_info = api.image.upload_paths(dataset.id, names, paths)

print(f"{len(upload_info)} images successfully uploaded to Supervisely platform")
```

**Output:**

```python
# 4 images successfully uploaded to Supervisely platform
```

<figure><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79905215/209367771-ff6d5852-f153-4529-9092-f58bcb45a3cc.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## Upload images as NumPy matrix

### Single image

**Source code:**

```python
img_np = sly.image.read(path)

np_image_info = api.image.upload_np(dataset.id, name="Lemons-np.jpeg", img=img_np)

print(f"Image successfully uploaded as NumPy matrix to Supervisely (ID: {np_image_info.id})")
```

**Output:**

```python
# Image successfully uploaded as NumPy matrix to Supervisely (ID: 17539458)
```

### Upload list of images

**Source code:**

```python
names_np = [f"np-{name}" for name in names]
images_np = [sly.image.read(img_path) for img_path in paths]

np_images_info = api.image.upload_nps(dataset.id, names_np, images_np)

print(f"{len(images_np)} images successfully uploaded to platform as NumPy matrix")
```

**Output:**

```python
# 4 images successfully uploaded to platform as NumPy matrix
```

## Get information about images

### Single image

Get information about image from Supervisely by id.

**Source code:**

```python
image_info = api.image.get_info_by_id(image.id)

print(image_info)
```

**Output:**

```python
# ImageInfo(
#     id=17539453,
#     name='Lemons.jpeg',
#     link=None,
#     hash='0jirgXvKGTJ8Yi0I9nCdf9MllQ9jP3Les1fD7/dt+Zk=',
#     mime='image/jpeg',
#     ext='jpeg',
#     size=66066,
#     width=640,
#     height=427,
#     labels_count=0,
#     dataset_id=54008,
#     created_at='2022-12-23T15:57:35.707Z',
#     updated_at='2022-12-23T15:57:35.707Z',
#     meta={},
#     path_original='nAXBxaxQJRARr0Ljkj6FfREj1Fq89.jpg',
#     full_storage_url='https://dev.supervise.ly/h5unublic/images/original/3/e/OK/d8Y7NnEj1Fq89.jpg',
#     tags=[]
# )
```

You can also get information about image from Supervisely by name.

**Source code:**

```python
image_name = get_file_name(image.name)

image_info_by_name = api.image.get_info_by_name(dataset.id, image_name)

print(f"image name - {image_info_by_name.name}")
```

**Output:**

```python
# image name - Lemons.jpeg
```

### Get all images from dataset.

Get information about image from Supervisely by id.

**Source code:**

print(f"{len(image_info_list)} images information received.")
```

**Output:**

```python
# 10 images information received.
```

## Download images to local directory

### Single image

Download image from Supervisely to local directory by id.

**Source code:**

```python
save_path = os.path.join(result_dir, image_info.name)

api.image.download_path(image_info.id, save_path)

print(f"Image has been successfully downloaded to '{save_path}'")
```

**Output:**

```python
# Image has been successfully downloaded to 'src/images/result/Lemons.jpeg'
```

### Download list of images to local directory

Download list of images from Supervisely to local directory by ids.

**Source code:**

```python
image_ids = [img.id for img in image_info_list]
image_names = [img.name for img in image_info_list]
save_paths = [os.path.join(result_dir, img_name) for img_name in image_names]

api.image.download_paths(dataset.id, image_ids, save_paths)

print(f"{len(image_info_list)} images has been successfully downloaded.")
```

**Output:**

```python
# 10 images has been successfully downloaded.

new_image_info = api.image.update_meta(id=image.id, meta=new_meta)

print(new_image_info["meta"])
```

**Output:**

```python
