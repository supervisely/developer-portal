---

# Spatial labels on volumes

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to programmatically create classes, objects, figures, its geometries for DICOM volumes and upload them to Supervisely platform. 

Supervisely supports different types of shapes/geometries for volume annotation:

* Mask 3D
* Mask (also known as Bitmap)
* Bounding Box (rectangle)* - will be covered in other tutorials
* Polygon - will be covered in other tutorials* 

Learn more about [Supervisely Annotation in JSON format](https://developer.supervisely.com/api-references/supervisely-annotation-json-format/volumes-annotation) for volumes.

You can also use ready-made solutions for labeling. Read about how it works in our blog article [Best DICOM & NIfTI annotation tools for Medical Imaging AI](https://supervisely.com/blog/dicom-labeling-toolbox/) and take full advantage of our platform.

Everything you need to reproduce [this tutorial is on GitHub](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/dicom-spatial-figures): source code, Visual Studio Code configuration, and a shell script for creating virtual env.

## How to debug this tutorial

**Step 1.** Prepare  `~/supervisely.env` file with credentials. [Learn more here.](../basics-of-authentication.md#use-.env-file-recommended)

**Step 2.** Clone the [repository](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/dicom-spatial-figures) with source code and demo data and create a [Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/dicom-spatial-figures
cd dicom-spatial-figures
./create_venv.sh
```

**Step 3.** Open the repository directory in Visual Studio Code.&#x20;

```bash
code -r .
```

**Step 4.** Change ‚úÖ workspace ID ‚úÖ in `local.env` file by copying the ID from the context menu of the workspace. A new project with annotated videos will be created in the workspace you define:

```python
WORKSPACE_ID=507 # ‚¨ÖÔ∏è change value
```

**Step 5.** Start debugging `src/main.py`&#x20;

## Python Code

### &#x20;Import libraries

```python
import os

from dotenv import load_dotenv

import supervisely as sly
import numpy as np
```

### &#x20;Init API client

Init API for communicating with Supervisely Instance. First, we load environment variables with credentials and workspace ID:

```python
if sly.is_development():
    load_dotenv("local.env")
    load_dotenv(os.path.expanduser("~/supervisely.env"))

api = sly.Api()
```

With the next lines, we will check that you did everything right - the API client initialized with the correct credentials and you defined the correct workspace ID in `local.env`.

```python
workspace_id = sly.env.workspace_id()
workspace = api.workspace.get_info_by_id(workspace_id)
if workspace is None:
    print("you should put correct workspaceId value to local.env")
    raise ValueError(f"Workspace with id={workspace_id} not found")
```

### Create project

Create an empty project with the name **"DICOM Volumes Demo"** with one dataset **"Lungs"** in your workspace on the server. If a project with the same name exists in your dataset, it will be automatically renamed (DICOM Volumes Demo\_001, DICOM Volumes Demo\_002, etc.) to avoid name collisions.&#x20;

```python
project = api.project.create(
    workspace.id,
    name="DICOM Volumes Demo",
    type=sly.ProjectType.VOLUMES,
    change_name_if_conflict=True,
)
dataset = api.dataset.create(project.id, name="CTChest")
sly.logger.info(f"Project has been sucessfully created, id={project.id}")
```

### Upload DICOM volume to the dataset on the server

The volume data will be represented as s set of `.dcm` files.

```python
dicom_dir_name = "data/CTChest"

series_infos = sly.volume.inspect_dicom_series(root_dir=dicom_dir_name)

for serie_id, files in series_infos.items():
    item_path = files[0]
    name = f"CTChest.nrrd"
    dicom_info = api.volume.upload_dicom_serie_paths(
        dataset_id=dataset.id,
        name=name,
        paths=files,
        anonymize=True,
    )
    sly.logger.info(
        f"DICOM volume has been uploaded to Supervisely with ID: {dicom_info.id}"
    )
```

### Create annotation classes and update project meta

In this tutorial, classes are created without the `color` argument, the color will be generated automatically.
To set the color for a class, you need to add the `color` argument.

```python
lung_obj_class = sly.ObjClass("lung", sly.Mask3D)
body_obj_class = sly.ObjClass("body", sly.Bitmap)
```

The next step is to create ProjectMeta - a collection of annotation classes and tags that will be available for labeling in the project.

```python
project_meta = sly.ProjectMeta(obj_classes=[lung_obj_class, body_obj_class])
```

Finally, we need to send all this data to our project to the server:

```python
api.project.update_meta(project.id, project_meta.to_json())
```

### Prepare source data for Mask (Bitmap)

```python
# full raw data for the Mask (Bitmap) can be found in main.py
raw_bitmap_data = "eJwBDgjx94lQTkcNChoKAAAADUlIRFIAAAGgAAABRgEDAAAAFu..."
```

### Create a volume object for Mask named 'body'

The object must be bound to the corresponding class

```python
body = sly.VolumeObject(body_obj_class)
```

### Create Mask figure

Before creating the geometry, we need to convert the raw data into an `ndarray`. For this purpose will be used method `base64_2_data`.
After that, define the `PointLocation` to properly apply the mask to the image. This point indicates where the top-left corner of the mask is located, or in other words, the coordinates of the mask's initial position on the canvas or image.
Once the geometry is created, it's time to prepare the `VolumeFigure`. To do this, we use a `VolumeObject` named **"body"**, and geometry and select the plane (`"axial"`) where the figure will be placed, the slice number which represents a certain image on this plane.

```python
bitmap_data = sly.Bitmap.base64_2_data(raw_bitmap_data)
bitmap_origin = sly.PointLocation(91, 36)
bitmap_geometry = sly.Bitmap(bitmap_data, bitmap_origin)
bitmap_figure = sly.VolumeFigure(body, bitmap_geometry, "axial", 69)
```

### Create `Slice` and `Plane` objects

```python
volume_slice = sly.Slice(69, figures=[bitmap_figure])
plane = sly.Plane(
    plane_name="axial", 
    items=[volume_slice], 
    volume_meta=dicom_info.meta
)
```

### Prepare source data for Mask 3D

For this type of shape, we will use the prepared .nrrd file to load geometry as bytes

```python
mask_dir_name = "data/mask"
mask_path = os.path.join(mask_dir_name, "lung.nrrd")
with open(mask_path, "rb") as file:
    geometry_bytes = file.read()
```

### Create a volume object for Mask 3D named 'lung'

```python
lung = sly.VolumeObject(lung_obj_class)
```

### Create an empty Mask 3D figure

This empty spatial figure will be uploaded as a dummy for future geometry loading and thus conversion to a normal spatial figure. 

```python
empty_figure = sly.VolumeFigure(
    lung, 
    sly.Mask3D(np.zeros((3, 3, 3), dtype=np.bool_)), 
    None, 
    None
)
```

### Create `VolumeObjectCollection`

This will allow us to add all the volume objects at once.

```python
objects = sly.VolumeObjectCollection([lung, body])
```

### Create volume annotation

For more information about the VolumeAnnotation in JSON format, please use the link at the beginning of this article

{% hint style="info" %}
üí°**2D figures** will be added as common figures with planes, a **3D figures**  - always are spatial figures!
{% endhint %}

```python
volume_ann = sly.VolumeAnnotation(
    dicom_info.meta,
    objects,
    plane_axial=plane,
    spatial_figures=[empty_figure],
)
```

### Upload annotation to the volume on the server

```python
key_id_map = sly.KeyIdMap()
api.volume.annotation.append(
    dicom_info.id,
    volume_ann, 
    key_id_map
)
sly.logger.info(f"Annotation has been sucessfully uploaded to the Volume {dicom_info.name}")
```

### Upload geometry to Mask 3D spatial figure

```python
api.volume.figure.upload_sf_geometry(
    volume_ann.spatial_figures,
    [geometry_bytes], 
    key_id_map
)
sly.logger.info(f"Geometry has been sucessfully uploaded to the figure")
```
