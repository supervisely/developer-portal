# Iterate over a project

In this article, we will learn how to iterate through a project with annotated data in python. It is one of the most frequent operations in Superviely Apps and python automation scripts.

{% hint style="info" %}
Everything you need to reproduce [this tutorial is on GitHub](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/iterate-over-project): source code, Visual Studio code configuration, and a shell script for creating venv.
{% endhint %}

In this guide we will go through the following steps:

****[**Step 1.**](iterate-over-a-project.md#demo-project) Get a [demo project](https://ecosystem.supervise.ly/projects/lemons-annotated) with labeled lemons and kiwis.

****[**Step 2.**](iterate-over-a-project.md#.env-file) Prepare `.env` file with credentials and ID of demo project.&#x20;

****[**Step 3.**](iterate-over-a-project.md#python-script) Run [python script](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/iterate-over-project/blob/master/main.py).

****[**Step 4**](iterate-over-a-project.md#optimizations)**.** Show possible optimizations.

### 1. Demo project

If you don't have any projects yet, go to the ecosystem and add the demo project üçã **`Lemons annotated`** to your current workspace.

![Add demo project "Lemons annotated" to your workjspace](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12828725/180640631-8636ac88-a8f7-4f72-90bb-84438d12f247.png)

### 2. `.env` files

Create a file at `~/supervisely.env`. Learn more about environment variables [here](environment-variables.md). The content should look like this:

```python
# your API credentials, learn more here: https://developer.supervise.ly/getting-started/basics-of-authentication
SERVER_ADDRESS="https://app.supervise.ly" # ‚¨ÖÔ∏è change it if use Enterprise Edition
API_TOKEN="4r47N.....blablabla......xaTatb" # ‚¨ÖÔ∏è change it
```

Create the second file `local.env` and place it in the same directory with the `main.py`. This file will contain values we are going to use in the python script.

```python
# change the Project ID to your value
modal.state.slyProjectId=12208 # ‚¨ÖÔ∏è change it
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The reason why the variable for Project ID has such strange name **`modal.state.slyProjectId`** will be explained later in the next tutorials. Let's just keep it this way for now.
{% endhint %}

### 3. Python script

{% hint style="info" %}
This script illustrates only the basics. If your project is huge and has **hundreds of thousands of images** then it is not so efficient to download annotations one by one. It is better to use batch (bulk) methods to reduce the number of API requests and significantly speed up your code. Learn more in [the optimizations section](iterate-over-a-project.md#optimizations) below.
{% endhint %}

Just clone the [repo](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/iterate-over-project), create [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) by running the script [`create_venv.sh`](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/iterate-over-project/blob/master/create\_venv.sh) and start debugging.

#### Source code:

```python
import os
import supervisely as sly
from dotenv import load_dotenv


load_dotenv("local.env")
load_dotenv(os.path.expanduser("~/supervisely.env"))

api = sly.Api.from_env()

project_id = int(os.environ["modal.state.slyProjectId"])
project = api.project.get_info_by_id(project_id)
if project is None:
    raise KeyError(f"Project with ID {project_id} not found in your account")
print(f"Project info: {project.name} (id={project.id})")

# get project meta - list of annotation classes and tags
meta_json = api.project.get_meta(project.id)
project_meta = sly.ProjectMeta.from_json(meta_json)
print(project_meta)

datasets = api.dataset.get_list(project.id)
print(f"There are {len(datasets)} datasets in project")

for dataset in datasets:
    print(f"Dataset {dataset.name} has {dataset.items_count} images")
    images = api.image.get_list(dataset.id)
    for image in images:
        ann_json = api.annotation.download_json(image.id)
        ann = sly.Annotation.from_json(ann_json, project_meta)
        print(f"There are {len(ann.labels)} objects on image {image.name}")
```

#### Output

The script above produces the following output:

```
Project info: Lemons (Annotated) (id=12208)
ProjectMeta:
Object Classes
+-------+--------+----------------+--------+
|  Name | Shape  |     Color      | Hotkey |
+-------+--------+----------------+--------+
|  kiwi | Bitmap |  [255, 0, 0]   |        |
| lemon | Bitmap | [81, 198, 170] |        |
+-------+--------+----------------+--------+
Tags

| Name | Value type | Possible values | Hotkey | Applicable to | Applicable classes |
+------+------------+-----------------+--------+---------------+--------------------+
+------+------------+-----------------+--------+---------------+--------------------+

There are 1 datasets in project
Dataset ds1 has 6 images
There are 3 objects on image IMG_1836.jpeg
There are 4 objects on image IMG_8144.jpeg
There are 4 objects on image IMG_3861.jpeg
There are 3 objects on image IMG_0748.jpeg
There are 5 objects on image IMG_4451.jpeg
There are 7 objects on image IMG_2084.jpeg
```

### 4. Optimizations

The bottleneck of this script is in these lines ([26-27](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/iterate-over-project/blob/1d0f28a75058a86052475c1079ce99a749c3f133/main.py#L26-L27)):

```python
for image in images:
    ann_json = api.annotation.download_json(image.id)
```

If you have **1M** images in your project, your code will send üü° **1M** requests to download annotations. It is inefficient due to Round Trip Time (RTT) and a large number of similar requests to a Supervisely database.&#x20;

It can be optimized by using batch API method:&#x20;

```python
api.annotation.download_json_batch(dataset.id, image_ids) 
```

Supervisely API allows downloading annotations for multiple images in a single request. The code sample below sends ‚úÖ **50x fewer** requests and it leads to a significant speed-up of our original code:

```python
for batch in sly.batched(images):
    image_ids = [image.id for image in batch]
    annotations = api.annotation.download_json_batch(dataset.id, image_ids)
    for image, ann_json in zip(batch, annotations):
        ann = sly.Annotation.from_json(ann_json, project_meta)
        print(f"There are {len(ann.labels)} objects on image {image.name}")
```

The optimized version of the original script is in [`main_optimized.py`](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/iterate-over-project/blob/master/main\_optimized.py).
