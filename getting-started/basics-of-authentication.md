# Basics of authentication

The easiest and best way to authenticate with the Supervisely API is by using Basic Authentication via a personal access token.

You need only two environment variables:

1. ``[`SERVER_ADDRESS`](basics-of-authentication.md#server\_address-env) - address of your Supervisely instance
2. ``[`API_TOKEN`](basics-of-authentication.md#api\_token-env) - your personal access token

### `SERVER_ADDRESS` env

If you are using [üåé](basics-of-authentication.md#community) **Community Edition** [üåé](basics-of-authentication.md#community)your server address is `https://app.supervise.ly`

If you are using üîê <mark style="color:purple;">**Enterprise Edition**</mark>** ** üîê you have your own instance address. You can copy the URL address from the browser or contact instance admin. For example on my private instance the address is the following:

![My private instance of Supervisely](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12828725/178995621-5d6b363b-e3c3-4653-8a58-95b9c8f62b34.png)

In the example above the server address is `https://dev.supervise.ly`

### `API_TOKEN` env

Every basic account has its own personal access token in account settings:

1. Find `Account Settings` under your name in the right top corner.
2. Go to `API Token` tab.
3. Press copy button.

You can revoke your current token and generate the new one at any time by clicking `re-generate api key` button.

### How to use in Python

To communicate with the Supervisely platform, you first need to instantiate a client. The easiest way to do that is by calling the function  [`from_env()`](https://supervisely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sdk/supervisely.api.api.Api.html#supervisely.api.api.Api.from\_env) or pass values of environment variables in the [constructor](https://supervisely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sdk/supervisely.api.api.Api.html#supervisely.api.api.Api).

#### Use `.env` file - recommended üëç

It is the default practice to store your secrets as environment variables and keep them save in `.evn` files for local development.&#x20;

1. Create .env file (for example `~/supervisely.env`) with the following content:

```python
SERVER_ADDRESS="https://app.supervise.ly"
API_TOKEN="4r47N...xaTatb"
```

2\. Use it the following way

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import supervisely as sly

load_dotenv(os.path.expanduser("~/supervisely.env"))
api = sly.Api.from_env()
```

#### Pass values into the API constructor

```python
import supervisely as sly

api = sly.Api(server_address="https://app.supervise.ly", token="4r47N...xaTatb")
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
We do not recommend using this way in production.\
\
It is the fastest way, but remember, it is not safe to store the secrets right in your sources. \
\
Avoid (_accidentally_) committing (_exposing_) your _private keys_, _passwords_ or other _sensitive details_ (_by hard-coding in them in your script_) to git by storing them as environment variables.
