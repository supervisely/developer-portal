# Installation

This part of the documentation covers the installation of Supervisely SDK for Python. The first step to using any software package is getting it properly installed.

## Prerequisites

### Python

At the moment Supervisely Python SDK supports üêç **Python 3.8 or greater** on the following OS:
- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows WSL
- Windows native (not recommended)

Options to install Python:
#### Homebrew (recommended)
1. Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
2. Install Python:<br>
```bash
# To install the latest version of Python:
brew install python
# To install specific version of Python (e.g. 3.8):
brew install python@3.8
```

#### Download from website
1. Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Ensure that the `python`/`python3` executable was added to your system path (e.g. for [Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6318156/adding-python-to-path-on-windows)).

#### Anaconda
1. Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download).
2. Install Python:<br>
```bash
# To install the latest version of Python:
conda install python
# To install specific version of Python (e.g. 3.8):
conda install python=3.8
```

### Libraries

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install ffmpeg libgeos-dev libsm6 libxext6 libexiv2-dev libxrender-dev libboost-all-dev -y
```

## Installation

### Pip

The latest stable version [is available on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/supervisely/). Either add `supervisely` to your `requirements.txt` file or install with pip:

```bash
pip3 install supervisely
```

We are constantly updating our SDK by adding new features and fixing bugs.  So if it is already installed on your dev environment, use the installation command with `--upgrade` flag:

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade supervisely 
```

### Source code

Supervisely is actively developed on GitHub, where the code is [always available](https://github.com/supervisely/supervisely).

You can either clone the public repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/supervisely/supervisely.git
```

Or, download the [zipball](https://github.com/supervisely/supervisely/archive/refs/heads/master.zip):

```bash
$ curl -OL https://github.com/supervisely/supervisely/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can embed it in your own Python package, or install it into your site-packages easily:

```bash
unzip master.zip
cd supervisely-master
python3 -m pip3 install .
```

## VENV

Here is a tiny bash script, that you can place at the root of your repository (for example `create_venv.sh`). It creates [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) - ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù isolated Python installation and installs packages into that virtual installation. When you switch projects, you can simply create a new virtual environment and not have to worry about breaking the packages installed in the other environments. It is always recommended to use a virtual environment while developing Python applications.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# learn more in documentation
# Official python docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html

if [ -d ".venv" ]; then
    echo "VENV already exists, will be removed"
    rm -rf .venv
fi

echo "VENV will be created" && \
python3 -m venv .venv && \
source .venv/bin/activate && \

echo "Install requirements..." && \
pip3 install -r requirements.txt && \
echo "Requirements have been successfully installed" && \
deactivate
```

## Docker image

Supervisely SDK for python also has prebuilt [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/supervisely/base-py-sdk) with everything already installed.

You can use the latest version

```bash
docker pull supervisely/base-py-sdk:latest
```

or some specific on that has completely the same tag as [PIP releases](https://pypi.org/project/supervisely/), for example:

```bash
docker pull supervisely/base-py-sdk:6.33.0
```

Here are the links to dockerfiles ([base image](https://github.com/supervisely/supervisely/blob/master/base\_images/py/Dockerfile), [result image](https://github.com/supervisely/supervisely/blob/master/base\_images/py\_sdk/Dockerfile)) where you can find the complete list of all recommended dependencies.
