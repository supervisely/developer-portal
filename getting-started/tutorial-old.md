## **Let's rock**

#### 1. Introduction

Applications in Supervisely are key to solving highly specialized Computer Vision problems. In the application catalog ([Ecosystem](https://app.supervise.ly/ecosystem/)) you can find applications for many different Computer Vision tasks. We have provided the ability to create new applications by third-party developers and modify existing ones.

This guide is designed to help a Python programmer develop, debug, and integrate applications to Supervisely.
