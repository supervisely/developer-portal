## Supervisely Platform ðŸ”¥

![](<.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-07-08 at 16.00.06.png>)

You can think of [Supervisely](https://supervise.ly/) as an Operating System available via Web Browser to help you solve Computer Vision tasks. The idea is to unify all the relevant tools within a single [Ecosystem](https://ecosystem.supervise.ly/) of apps, tools, UI widgets and services that may be needed to make the AI development process as smooth and fast as possible.

More concretely, Supervisely includes the following functionality:

* Data labeling for images, videos, 3D point cloud and volumetric medical images (dicom)
* Data visualization and quality control
* State-Of-The-Art Deep Learning models for segmentation, detection, classification and other tasks
* Interactive tools for model performance analysis
* Specialized Deep Learning models to speed up data labeling (aka AI-assisted labeling)
* Synthetic data generation tools
* Instruments to make it easier to collaborate for data scientists, data labelers, domain experts and software engineers

## Supervisely Ecosystem ðŸŽ‰





Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes. All in pure Python. No frontâ€‘end experience required.



Backup **deployment**

One challenge is to make it possible for everyone to train and apply SOTA Deep Learning models directly from the Web Browser. To address it, we introduce an open sourced Supervisely Agent. All you need to do is to execute a single command on your machine with the GPU that installs the Agent. After that, you keep working in the browser and all the GPU related computations will be performed on the connected machine(s).



```python
import supervisely as sly

print(134)
```
