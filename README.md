# üë®üíª Supervisely Developer Portal

## Introduction

Every company wants to be sure that its current and future AI tasks are solvable.&#x20;

The main issue with most solutions on the market is that they build as products. It's a black box developing by some company you don't really have an impact on. As soon as your requirements go beyond basic features offered and you want to customize your experience, add something that is not in line with the software owner development plans or won't benefit other customers, you're out of luck.

That is why **Supervisely is building a platform** instead of a product.&#x20;

### [Supervisely Platform üî•](https://supervise.ly/)

You can think of [Supervisely](https://supervise.ly/) as an Operating System available via Web Browser to help you solve Computer Vision tasks. The idea is to unify all the relevant tools within a single [Ecosystem](https://ecosystem.supervise.ly/) of apps, tools, UI widgets and services that may be needed to make the AI development process as smooth and fast as possible.

More concretely, Supervisely includes the following functionality:

* Data labeling for images, videos, 3D point cloud and volumetric medical images (dicom)
* Data visualization and quality control
* State-Of-The-Art Deep Learning models for segmentation, detection, classification and other tasks
* Interactive tools for model performance analysis
* Specialized Deep Learning models to speed up data labeling (aka AI-assisted labeling)
* Synthetic data generation tools
* Instruments to make it easier to collaborate for data scientists, data labelers, domain experts and software engineers

### [Supervisely Ecosystem](https://supervise.ly/ecosystem) üéâ

![](.gitbook/assets/image.png)

Simplicity of creating Supervisely Apps has already led to the development of [hundreds of applications](https://ecosystem.supervise.ly/), ready to be run within a single click in web browser and get the job done.

Label your data, perform quality assurance, inspect every aspect of your data, collaborate easily, train and apply state-of-the-art neural networks, integrate custom models, automate routine tasks and more ‚Äî like in a real AppStore, there should be an app for everything.

## Development&#x20;

Supervisely provides the foundation for developing and running computer vision applications to address your custom tasks - just like in OS, like Windows or MacOS.&#x20;

### Principles

Development for Supervisely builds upon these five principles:

* All in **pure Python** and build on top of your favourites libraries (opencv, requests, fastapi, pytorch, imgaug, etc ...) - easy for python developers and data scientists to build and share apps with teammates and the ML community.
* No front‚Äëend experience is required -  build **powerful** and **interactive** web-based GUI apps using the comprehensive library of ready-to-use UI widgets and components.
* **Easy to learn, fast to code** and **ready for production**.  SDK provides a simple and intuitive API by having complexity "under the hood". Every action can be done just in a few lines of code. You focus on your task, Supervisely will handle everything else - interfaces, databases, permissions, security, deployment, networking, data storage and many more. Supervisely has solid testing, documentation and support.
* Everything is **customizable** - from labeling interfaces to neural networks. The platform has to be customized and extended to perfectly fit your tasks and requirements, not vice versa. Hundreds of examples cover every scenario and can be found in our [ecosystem of apps](https://ecosystem.supervise.ly/).
* Apps can be both **open-sourced or private**. All apps made by Supervisely team are [open-sourced](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem). Use them as examples, just fork and modify the way you want. But —Åustomers and community users can still develop private apps to keep their intellectual property safe.\
