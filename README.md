# ðŸ‘¨ðŸ’» Supervisely Developer Portal

## Introduction

Every company wants to be sure that its current and future AI tasks are solvable.&#x20;

The main issue with most solutions on the market is that they build as products. It's a black box developing by some company you don't really have an impact on. As soon as your requirements go beyond basic features offered and you want to customize your experience, add something that is not in line with the software owner development plans or won't benefit other customers, you're out of luck.

That is why **Supervisely is building a platform** instead of a product.&#x20;

### [Supervisely Platform ðŸ”¥](https://supervise.ly/)

You can think of [Supervisely](https://supervise.ly/) as an Operating System available via Web Browser to help you solve Computer Vision tasks. The idea is to unify all the relevant tools within a single [Ecosystem](https://ecosystem.supervise.ly/) of apps, tools, UI widgets and services that may be needed to make the AI development process as smooth and fast as possible.

More concretely, Supervisely includes the following functionality:

* Data labeling for images, videos, 3D point cloud and volumetric medical images (dicom)
* Data visualization and quality control
* State-Of-The-Art Deep Learning models for segmentation, detection, classification and other tasks
* Interactive tools for model performance analysis
* Specialized Deep Learning models to speed up data labeling (aka AI-assisted labeling)
* Synthetic data generation tools
* Instruments to make it easier to collaborate for data scientists, data labelers, domain experts and software engineers

### [Supervisely Ecosystem](https://supervise.ly/ecosystem) ðŸŽ‰

Simplicity of creating Supervisely Apps has already led to the development of [hundreds of applications](https://ecosystem.supervise.ly/), ready to be run within a single click in web browser and get the job done.

Label your data, perform quality assurance, inspect every aspect of your data, collaborate easily, train and apply state-of-the-art neural networks, integrate custom models, automate routine tasks and more â€” like in a real AppStore, there should be an app for everything.

## Development&#x20;

Supervisely provides the foundation for developing and running computer vision applications to address your custom tasks - just like in OS, like Windows or MacOS.&#x20;



Supervisely's open-source SDK and app framework is straightforward to get started with. Itâ€™s just a matter of:

```
pip install supervisely
```

Development for Supervisely builds upon these principles:

_Supervisely SDK for Python, high performance, easy to learn, fast to code, ready for production_

Streamlit turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes. All in pure Python. No frontâ€‘end experience required.



Backup **deployment**

One challenge is to make it possible for everyone to train and apply SOTA Deep Learning models directly from the Web Browser. To address it, we introduce an open sourced Supervisely Agent. All you need to do is to execute a single command on your machine with the GPU that installs the Agent. After that, you keep working in the browser and all the GPU related computations will be performed on the connected machine(s).



```python
import supervisely as sly

print(134)
```
