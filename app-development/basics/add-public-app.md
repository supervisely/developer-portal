# Add public app

## Introduction

Supervisely supports both private and public apps.

ðŸ”’ **Private apps** are those that are available only on your private Supervisely Instance (Enterprise Edition) in your account. The guidelines for adding public apps is [this tutorial](add-private-app.md).

ðŸŒŽ **Public apps** are available on all private Supervisely Instances and in Community Edition.

This tutorial covers the case of adding a public app. It means that this app is open-sourced and is available on all Supervisely instances (Community Edition and all private customer's instances with Enterprise Edition license).

### Step 1. Create a repository

Create an app repository on GitHub in a [Supervisely-ecosystem organization](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem). \*[How to create an app](from-script-to-supervisely-app.md)

### Step 2. Add GitHub workflow

Add a GitHub workflow files from [this repository](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/workflows):

1. To publish the app to the production (see step 3): [.github/workflows/publish.yml](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/workflows/blob/master/.github/workflows/publish.yml)
2. For version releases (see step 4.1): [.github/workflows/release.yml](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/workflows/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml)
3. For branch releases (see step 4.2): [.github/workflows/release\_branch.yml](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/workflows/blob/master/.github/workflows/release\_branch.yml)

{% hint style="info" %}
Workflow files to release the app as private and as public are the same. If you already have `.github/workflows/release.yml` or `.github/workflows/release_branch.yml` you only need to add `.github/workflows/publish.yml` file.
{% endhint %}

```yaml
name: Release
run-name: Release version "${{ github.event.release.tag_name }}"
on:
  release:
    types: [published]
    branches:
      - main
      - master
jobs:
  Supervisely-Release:
    ***
    with:
      ***
      SUBAPP_PATHS: "__ROOT_APP__, subapp" <-- Change this variable
```

In each of this files, you should change the following variable: `SUBAPP_PATHS` - Paths to directories with applications within the repository (directory where the `config.json` file is located). If the application is located in a root directory, then you should specify `__ROOT_APP__` instead of the path. Paths should be separated by commas.

In the example above, releases are configured for two applications in the repository: the one which is located in `root` directory and the one which is located in the `subapp` directory. Example for the repository with two applications, located in `train` and `serve` directories: `SUBAPP_PATHS: "train, serve"`.

### Step 3. Publish to production

Workflow files to release the app as private and as public are the same. To make your private app public you need to run `Publish to production` workflow.

This workflow will create a public release for all the GitHub releases in the repository. Only releases with valid version names (in semver format) will be published.

To run the workflow you need to go to the `Actions` tab of the repository and select the `Publish app to production` workflow. Then click on the `Run workflow` button. Do not change the Target of the release. It should always be `main` or `master`.

![Publish](https://github.com/supervisely/developer-portal/assets/61844772/6ba9c41a-1b6b-4371-9d09-ba417c7bb9ca)

After the app is published to the production you will no longer be able to create releases via CLI tool and you will need to create releases via GitHub interface. How to do it is described below in steps 3.2 and 3.3.

### Step 4. Create a release

#### 4.1 Version release

The workflow we created in the previous step will be triggered when you publish a release in the repository.

To create a release, go to the repository page on GitHub and click on the `Releases` tab. Then click on the `Create a new release` or `Draft a new release` button. Choose a tag version in semver format (v1.0.0) and a release title. Then click on the `Publish release` button.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Do not change the Target of the release. It should always be `main` or `master`.

#### 4.2 Branch release

The workflow we created in the previous step will be triggered when you push a branch (except "main" or "master") in the repository.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can disable branch release by adding branch name to `branches-ignore` list in the `.github/workflows/release_branch.yml` workflow file. See below
{% endhint %}

```yaml
name: Release branch
run-name: Release "${{ github.ref_name }}" branch
on:
  push:
    branches-ignore:
      - main
      - master
      - branch-to-ignore <-- Add branch name here
jobs:
  Supervisely-Release:
```

#### After the release is published the workflow will be triggered and you can see the release progress in the `Actions` tab. If the workflow is successful, the app will appear in the ecosystem.

## App development process

### App Development and local tests

The developer creates the application and tests it locally.

### Testing on development instance

When you done with development and local tests, you can test your app on the development instance. To do so you need to create a private app on the development instance and then create a new release. \*[How to add private app](add-private-app.md).

The preferred way is to use CLI tool from the SDK. From the environment where you have installed the SDK, run the following command: `supervisely release` and follow the instructions. Make sure you set the correct server address and API token. After the release is created, you can find the application in the [Private apps tab of the ecosystem](https://dev.supervise.ly/ecosystem/private).

{% hint style="info" %}
For development in a team you need to add `APP_RELEASE_TOKEN` variable to your `~/supervisely.env` file. Ask the administrator for the token.
{% endhint %}

### Releasing the app to the public

When you are ready to publish your app to the public, you need to create a public app. To do so you need to follow the steps described in the [steps 1 to 3](add-public-app.md#step-1-create-a-repository) of this tutorial. After the app is published to the public you will no longer be able to create releases via CLI tool.

{% hint style="info" %}
Do not forget to add the app to the [README\_v2](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/repository/blob/master/README\_v2.md). It is needed for back-compatibility with older versions of Supervisley instances. To check that the app is released on older instances ask the administrator.
{% endhint %}

### Developing new features

{% hint style="warning" %}
Still in development
{% endhint %}

You may be asking yourself: "How can I develop new features for my app if I can't create releases via CLI tool?". There is a solution for that. Future feature development and testing are done in development branches (any branch other than `main` or `master`).

To activate this mechanism you need to add another workflow file to the repository: You can use [This file](https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/workflows/blob/master/.github/workflows/release\_dev.yml).

```yaml
name: Supervisely release
run-name: Supervisely ${{ github.repository }} app release
on:
  push:
    branches-ignore:
      - main
      - master
jobs:
    ***
      SUBAPP_PATHS: "__ROOT_APP__, subapp"
```

Same as in [step 2](add-public-app.md#step-2-add-github-workflow) you need to change the `SUBAPP_PATHS` variable.

This workflow will be triggered on any push to any branch other than `main` or `master`. It will create a release with the name of the branch. For example, if you push to the `dev` branch, the release will be created with the version `dev` and the name `dev branch release`.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also limit branches on which the workflow will be triggered. To do so you need to replace `branches-ignore` parameter with `branches` parameter to the `on` section of the workflow. For example, if you want to trigger the workflow only on the `test` branch you need to add on: push: branches: - test
{% endhint %}

### Updating the app

When you need to update the app, you need to create a new release. It is described in [step 4](add-public-app.md#step-4-updating-the-app) of this tutorial.
