# Integrate your custom NN model with GUI

TODO: Screenshot with base serving

From this section you'll learn how to add user interface to your integrated neural network. 
This is a continuation of tutorial [Serving App](../inference/overview-nn-integration.md). if you have not read this before, it is recommended that you see this section first.

You can serve integrated neural network without GUI, but also you can add user interface to make your app more convinient and customizable. We propose base user interface tools for most-used cases and also support creation of custom user interface.

In this tutorial you learn how to:
1) use our base GUI for your list of pretrained models or models uploaded to Team Files in Supervisely
2) customize our base GUI to your case
3) develop your custom GUI using widgets from Supervisely
