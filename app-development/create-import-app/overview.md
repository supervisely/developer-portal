# Custom Import

This guide provides guidance on how to create a custom Supervisely import application.

We recommend to use import template for creating custom import applications using class `sly.app.Import` from Supervisely SDK. It is the easiest way to create import app with convenient GUI and designed to speed up and simplify the development of import apps.

* [Learn how to create import app with template](./create-import-app-from-template.md)

However, if your use case is not covered by our import template, you can create your own app **from scratch**  without the template using basic methods and [widgets](../widgets/README.md) from Supervisely SDK.

* [Learn how to create import app from scratch](./create-import-app-without-template.md)
* [Learn how to create import app from scratch with GUI](./create-import-app-without-template-gui.md)

## `sly.app.Import` advantages

üíª [Source code](https://github.com/supervisely/supervisely/blob/master/supervisely/app/import_template.py)

`sly.app.Import` class will handle import routines for you:

- ‚úÖ Check that the selected team, workspace, project or dataset exists and that you have access to it
- ‚¨áÔ∏è Download your data from the Supervisely platform to a remote container or local hard drive if you are debugging your app
- ü™Ñ Automatically detect app context with all required information for creating import app
- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Upload result data to new or existing Supervisely project or dataset
- üßπ Remove source directory from Team Files after successful import

`sly.app.Import` has a `Context` subclass which contains all required information that you need for importing your data from the Supervisely platform:

- `Team ID` - ID of the destination Team
- `Workspace ID` - ID of the destination Workspace
- `Project ID` - ID of an existing project to which data will be imported. None if you import data to a new project
- `Dataset ID` - ID of an existing dataset to which data will be imported. None if you import data to a new dataset
- `Path` - Path to your data on the local machine. 
- `Project name` - name of the project provided in the GUI if import data to new project
- `Progress` - `tqdm` progress that you can use in your app
- `Is directory` - Shows if your data is a directory or file
- `Is on agent` - Shows if your data is located on the agent or not

`context` variable is passed as an argument to the `process` method of class `MyImport` and the `context` object will be created automatically when you execute import script.

```python
class MyImport(sly.app.Import):
    def process(self, context: sly.app.Import.Context):
        print(context)
```

Output:

```text
Team ID: 8
Workspace ID: 349
Project ID: 8534
Dataset ID: 22852
Path: /data/my_file.txt
Project name: ""
Is directory: False
Is on agent: False
```

## `sly.app.Import` custom settings

Import template is flexible and allows you to add custom settings to your import app. You can add custom settings to the import template using the `add_custom_settings` method. This method should return a [`Container`](../widgets/layouts-and-containers/container.md) widget with custom settings.

```python
class MyImport(sly.app.Import):
    def add_custom_settings(self):
        # create widget
        self.ann_checkbox = sly.app.widgets.Checkbox("Upload annotations", True)
        # return Container with your widget
        return sly.app.widgets.Container(widgets=[self.ann_checkbox])
        
    def process(self, context: sly.app.Import.Context):
        ...
        # get widget state in code
        with_annotations = self.ann_checkbox.is_checked()
        ...
```

## Set up an environment for the development

We advise reading our [from script to supervisely app](../basics/from-script-to-supervisely-app.md) guide if you are unfamiliar with the [file structure](../basics/from-script-to-supervisely-app.md#repository-structure) of a Supervisely app repository because it addresses the majority of the potential questions.

**For both options, you need to prepare a development environment. Follow the steps below:**

**Step 1.** Prepare `~/supervisely.env` file with credentials. [Learn more here.](../../getting-started/basics-of-authentication.md#how-to-use-in-python)

**Step 2.** Fork and clone the repository with source code and create [Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

**for [import with template](./create-import-app-from-template.md):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/template-import-app
cd template-import-app
./create_venv.sh
```

**for [import from scratch](./create-import-app-without-template-gui.md)**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/supervisely-ecosystem/import-app-from-scratch
cd import-app-from-scratch
./create_venv.sh
```

**Step 3.** Open the repository directory in Visual Studio Code.

```bash
code -r .
```

**Step 4.** Select created virtual environment as a Python interpreter.

## How to run it in Supervisely

Submitting an app to the Supervisely Ecosystem isn‚Äôt as simple as pushing code to the GitHub repository, but it‚Äôs not as complicated as you may think of it either.

Please follow this [link](../basics/add-private-app.md) for instructions on adding your app. We have produced a step-by-step guide on how to add your application to the Supervisely Ecosystem.
